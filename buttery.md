# Eating at other Cambridge colleges

Students and visitors at Cambridge University can sometimes use the canteen of a college or department other than their own, but the various policies are rarely on public display (let alone online), so I’m posting this data from personal experience in the hope that it’s useful. Rules might have changed since I last checked.

College members typically have an internal identification card; others pay in cash (bank cards not accepted unless noted below) and can expect to be charged more.
