
REM Macro for the Lua version of Notesorg, (C) 2007 Silas S. Brown.
REM Translate this using OPL, and set Macro5 to use the OPO (macro type: Macro)

REM Run the macro to organise the contents of C:\Documents\Word
REM (works if all the text is the same font etc)

REM The Lua version of notesorg is written without 'print'
REM statements, otherwise it will create a STDOUT window
REM every time the macro is run, and these can build up unless you close them from
REM the "Open files/programs" dialogue.  Closing any one will close all the others and
REM also Macro5 which then needs to be restarted. On at least some versions
REM of Macro5, you can add to the end of this macro the lines
REM FgApp%:("C:\System\Apps\Macro5\Macro5.app")
REM SendKey:("Ct+e")
REM hence causing it to exit Macro5 after every run, which will prevent the leaks
REM but you'll still need to restart Macro5 manually.
REM However, it's probably simpler not creating the STDOUT windows
REM in the first place.  But the user needs to be given some indication
REM that things are in progress, especially if the System screen
REM is being shown.
