Miscellaneous scripts etc from http://ssb22.user.srcf.net

(also mirrored at http://ssb22.gitlab.io/ just in case)

Most of the scripts in this repository are public domain or Apache2-licensed
(see comments at start of each script).  Only two are GPL: cdrdao.py
(because the underlying cdrdao utility is GPL) and offline-updater (because
the underlying Debian infrastructure is GPL).  I have therefore set the
master license file of this repository to "GPL" to cover the most
restrictive case, but that doesn't mean you can't take an individual file
that says "public domain" or "Apache 2" at the top and use it as such.  I
just thought these scripts are all too small to justify starting a separate
Git repository for every single one of them (as if I don't have enough Git
repositories alreadyâ˜º)
